# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assist a data journalist, Dana with gathering information on UFO sightings in different locations and presenting this data in a way that is easy for other UFOlogists to find and make use of. The analysis involves creating a table to organize UFO data and store it as a JavaScript array. This table will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language and will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria meaning that it will react to user input. All this information is then placed into an HTML file for easy viewing.

## Results
Below are the steps one would use when using the search criteria of the webpage:
- There are several options for one to use in searching up specific data, the search could be done by the date of the sighting, the city, the state, country or the shape of the sighting observed. One would just need to navigate to the 'Filter Search' section of the webpage and then type in the specific criteria needed in the applicable field. See the instances below:
- By date: simply enter the date of choice as per image below

- By city: enter the name of the city as in the image:

- by state: enter the name of the state like displayed:

- by multiple criteria: for example in the following image, we searched by both shape(triangle) and city of choice (pasadena)

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage would be the fact that the table doesn't automatically reset when the search fields are cleared, the webpage must be refreshed from the browser in order for the change to be reflected.
One recommendation for further development would be to add in some extra search criteria especially in a case where the data to be filtered would be more than that provided for this analysis project. Another recommendation would be to include other visualizations on the webpage such as colourful charts(and possibly filtering the data displayed in them as well)to assist in observing the trends of sightings across various locations over time.
