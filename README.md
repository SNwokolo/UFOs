## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assist a data journalist, Dana with gathering information on UFO sightings in different locations and presenting this data in a way that is easy for other UFOlogists to find and make use of. The analysis involves creating a table to organize UFO data and store it as a JavaScript array. This table will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language and will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria meaning that it will react to user input. All this information is then placed into an HTML file for easy viewing.
